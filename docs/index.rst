Welcome to Vanubuntu's documentation!
=====================================

If you're a developer looking to create a customized version of Vanubuntu, this documentation is for you. However, if you're a regular user, we recommend visiting the official Vanubuntu website or using the Help app within your Vanubuntu installation for general information and support.

VanubISO is a powerful tool that allows developers to create a chroot environment and select specific packages to include in their custom ISO. This tool is designed for developers and can be easily integrated into other programs with minimal modifications.

VanubISO is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3, or any later version you choose. By using VanubISO, you agree to the terms of this license.

Please note that some of the information in this documentation is specific to VanubISO and may not be relevant to regular Vanubuntu users. If you're looking for general information about Vanubuntu, we recommend visiting the official website or using the Help app within your installation.
